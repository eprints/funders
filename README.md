funders
=======

Modelling and capture of funders and projects into EPrints. This was initially developed for ROS submissions in the UK but should be usable on other contexts.

This contains:

- models for Project and Funder datasets + linking fields to publications
- One EPrint has linked to n Projects and m Funders
- utility script to import/process Projects and Funders from various sources including the RCUK portal Gateway to Research

This requires:

- the "modal" package (to select Projects/Funders on the eprint submission form)

This may be used with:

- the "report" package (Generic Reporting Framework) to report for (e.g.) ROS & open access compliance.
